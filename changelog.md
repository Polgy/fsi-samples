# Explanation of CUDA code

A CUDA kernel function was provided to perform bootstrapping on an array of data using parallel processing. The bootstrapping is a statistical resampling method used to estimate the distribution of a population from a sample.

The function took five input parameters:
- `result`: An array that stores the resampled data.
- `ref`: An array that contains the original data to be resampled.
- `block_size`: An integer that represents the size of each block of data.
- `num_positions`: The number of positions in the `result` array that need to be filled with resampled data.
- `positions`: An array that contains the starting indices for each block of resampled data.

The function used the CUDA parallel programming framework to perform the bootstrapping in parallel. It split the processing into blocks, where each block corresponded to a single position in the `result` array. Within each block, the processing was split into threads. 

Variables were used to keep track of the current sample, position, asset, and location being processed. An if statement checked whether the current position in the `result` array was within the bounds of the `ref` array. If it was, the value at that position in the `result` array was set to the value at the corresponding location in the `ref` array.

# Explanation of Numba code

A version of the code using Numba instead of CUDA was provided:

```python
import numba
import numpy as np

@numba.njit
def boot_strap(result, ref, block_size, num_positions, positions):
    sample, assets, length = result.shape
    for sample_id in range(sample):
        for position_id in range(num_positions):
            sample_at = positions[position_id + num_positions * sample_id]
            for asset_id in range(assets):
                for loc in range(block_size):
                    if (position_id * block_size + loc + 1 < length):
                        result[sample_id, asset_id, position_id * block_size + loc + 1] = ref[asset_id,  sample_at + loc]



```
